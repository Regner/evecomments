BLARG!
============

This project is for me and learning Flask and SQLAlchemy better. It will probably not become anything more. So please

Goal
============

Create a comment system similar to Disqus but that is open source, built in python, and most importantly supports the
EVE Online SSO.

Because I Always Forget

db_migrate migrate
